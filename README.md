ool Club Timing: Keeping Track of Gametime
A pool club timing system, often managed through a desktop pool timer application, is the central nervous system of a busy billiards establishment. It's designed to accurately track the duration of play on each table, and ultimately calculate the cost for customers. This ensures fair billing and efficient table rotation.

KeyFeature
-Table Status Display: Visually shows which tables are occupied, available, or perhaps reserved. This might use color-coding or clear labels.
-Start/Stop Functionality: Staff can easily start the timer for a specific table when customers begin playing and stop it when they finish.
-Billing Calculation: Automatically calculates the total cost based on the duration of play and the configured rate.
